rs-serve - A remotestorage server implementation
================================================

Dependencies

- GNU make
- pkg-config (or tweak the Makefile)
- gcc
- libc
- libevent (>= 2.0)
- libmagic

On Debian based systems, this should give you all you need:

If you want to develop, you may also want debug symbols and valgrind (required by leakcheck.sh script):

  apt-get install libevent-dbg valgrind

Building

Given you have all dependencies installed, simply run

  make

and you should be good to go.

To install it somewhere else, tweak the Makefile first.
