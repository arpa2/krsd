* TODO Add --group and --gid options
  These should cause a setegid() and chgrp() all created files / folders to that
  group. That way the process can run as a unprivileged user, while still being
  able to access all user's folder (provided the given group can read/write/execute
  the user's storage-root)
* TODO Add --user and --uid options
  These should cause the process to drop privileges after bind()ing.
* TODO Use user_entry->pw_dir to build the storage root
  Currently /home/{user}/{--dir} is the hardcoded way to build the storage-root.
  Instead this should be based on the system configuration.
